Awesome, I would love to see:

1. At individual contributor level, how many comments their PR is receiving. If
   someone's PR is consistently getting high level of comments then at some
   level, I can link it to software design issues. This may help us in guiding
   engs. in the right direction, if needed i.e. discuss / design before getting
   to coding / PR stage.

2. Also for the leaderboard, it would be interesting to see a split between
   points accrued due to comments, PR issued and PR merged.

3. Some representation of who's commenting on whose PRs. Would be good to see
   cross team contribution? Also if ppl are doing PR trade ;) - nice to have

I cannot think of anything else right now. I am sure more requests will come
your way as and when we use it.
