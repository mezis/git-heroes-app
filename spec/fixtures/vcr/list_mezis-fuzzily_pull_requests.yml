        The use of ActiveRecord''s #find meant missing IDs raised AR::RecordNotFound.
        This might come up if an object was created and then deleted without its trigram
        data also being deleted. To avoid the exception this uses #where instead of
        #find which will ignore missing results.\n> \n> Due to the method with which
        the records are sorted to match the trigram query, in these cases nils were
        cropping up in the results, so this uses #compact to just return the records.\n>
        \n> The first test case ensures no exceptions for missing objects are raised.
        The second test case ensures the fuzzy find still works and that no nils are
        returned.\n\n---\n\nExcuse the whitespace removal, that was done automatically.
