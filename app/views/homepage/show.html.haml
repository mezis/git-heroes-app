      We dislike lawerly terms and conditions as much as the next person. So like
      a few other companies, we're electing to keep things simple and readable.

    %ol
      %li
        By using Git Heroes, you agree to these terms. If you disagree, simply
        don't use the service.

      %li
        If these terms change, and you're a registered user, we will notify you.

      %li
        At times things can go wrong and the service may be interrupted.
        It's unlikely, but sometimes things can go really wrong.

      %li 
        The intellectual property any content pulled from Github repositories
        stays with its owners. We don't claim any ownership and will not share
        it beyond what you enabled through Github.

      %li
        To fully use the services, you'll need to create your own account by
        signing up with Github. This means we'll keep some personal data about you.

      %li
        We'll strive to keep any confidential information confidential, and will
        never share it with third parties.  This includes your Github data, user
        name, and email address.
        If anything seems untowards, contact us and we'll fix it as soon as
        possible.

      %li
        You can terminate your account at any time without cost.

      %li 
        "Git heroes" is our brand, and you may not use it our its logo without
        our permission.

      %li
        We are not liable if things go really wrong. Things can happen â€” we do our
        best.
