    :low:
      - Bit of a slow day? Or probably you were hyper focused on something.
      - Looks like maybe you had too many meetings?
      - Come on, we've seen you contribute a bit more :)
      - Hmmm, that feels a little low. Did we miss something?
      - Well, I'm certain we get get these figures to go up a bit today.
      - That's a good start. Read on for places to snatch up some karma...
    :medium:
      - Not bad at all; keep it coming!
      - Looks like this was a pretty good day for you.
      - Smooth. Now let's keep the good karma going.
    :high:
      - Let me just say this â€” you rock.
      - Wow, that was intense. Maybe take a breath today?
      - You were on a roll! Maybe don't work *that* hard.
      - With days like this, someone's gonna need a holiday.
      - You don't have to do *all* the things, you know.
      - Now, that's what I'm talking about.
      - Maybe leave some for the rest of the team though.
